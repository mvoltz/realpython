# these lyrics are probably wrong too. poor memory.

print(stringy[0])

# python indexes start at zero. So the first character 'T' is at position 0.

print(stringy[0:10])

# you can print a series of index values. This one starts at 0 and stops at 9 (not 10).

print(stringy[10:])

# you can also print from an index number to the end of the string.

print(stringy[15:-4])

# you can also print from an index to the end, minus some number of index values.

print(stringy[:])

# effectively prints everything
